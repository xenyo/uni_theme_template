# uni_theme_template

Drupal theme template for Xenyo Uni Framework.

## Quick start

## Decide theme name

Decide on a name for your new theme. The name must:

- Only include lowercase letters, digits and underscores.
- Begin with the namespace of the client.
- End with `_theme`. This is to reduce confusion between theme and module repositories.
